					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>I have found success and deep satisfaction in a non-confrontational, non-coercive approach to change in which people are invited to a new way.
						I am a passionate advocate of continual learning and improvement, seeking to understand the nature of software development from as many perspectives as possible.
						I gather ideas from a broad number of sources and pragmatically select and blend those that work in a given context, commonly pulling from topics such as systems theory, cognitive psychology, professional coaching, organizational dynamics, and even world history to find unique ideas.

					<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
					<!-- your work experience -->
					<h3><strong>ENTERPRISE AGILE COACH</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Newfold Digital | 2019 - Present | Burlington, MA USA
					</p>
					<p>
						I joined Newfold Digital, Endurance International Group at the time, to help lead the Domain.com business unit through an
						agile transformation into a technical and product juggernaut. Approximately one-year in pursuit of this effort, after making serious headway 
						and strangulating our Perl-based system into a robust modern Java code-base, we merged with web.com.
						<br> </br>
						I was swiftly moved to help unify the Storefront Business units for these very different pillars. I partnered with a Product-Marketing Vice President from web.com,
						and we co-led the newly merged vertical. We organized our test logic and scheduling.
						We worked Google Analytics deep into our flows and BI folks into our teams.
						We succeeded in getting our teams to review tableau dashboards and to debate or improve the logic of tests in standup.
						We more than tripled our story output under current conditions.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>	<strong>Leadership Based Highlights </strong>| Aided leadership in Mission and Goal development as well as
								developed and implemented roadmapping workshops for entire verticals that pulled business and tech people together.
								During these quarters the teams were the most productive, averaging 2.5x throughput.
						</li>
						<li>	<strong>Team Based Highlights </strong>| Successfully transformed the front of site teams to an empowered team model from a survivalist,
								non-optimized chief programmer model. This resulted in team 3x throughput, which gave confidence for them to take ownership of their pipelines and utilize OKD4.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><strong>AGILE COACH</strong></h3>
					<p>
						HealthEdge | 2016 - 2019 | Burlington, MA USA
					</p>
					<p>
						I joined HealthEdge to implement an agile culture and best technical practices after conducting initial
						waves of training and intense coaching. HealthEdge grew from 150 people with two domestic
						locations to 500+ people with five global locations during my tenure. Key to this growth ROI was
						changing the culture to celebrate collaboration that resulted in automation and hardening of several key
						components such as all testing, deployment to product and development, monitoring and self-healing.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>	<strong>Based Highlights</strong> | Presented key strategic workshops at user conference. Persuaded
								leadership to shift to team incentives from individual incentives. Brought transparency to decision-making 
								through workshops and delegation boards. Drove alignment around scrumâ€™s central
								conflict using facilitation, workshops, and working agreements.
						</li>
						<li>	<strong>Team Based Highlights</strong> | Top Impediment to Top Story in eight months tripled throughput. Onboarded
								23 teams into agility in India and US. Implemented Kanban with six full-stack support
								teams that reduced cycle time by 80%. Led high profile and high-risk DevOps experimental team
								that reduced deployment from one month with 30+ people to one-day, requiring one-person in six months.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><strong>TECHNICAL TRAINER AND SCRUM MASTER</strong></h3>
					<p>
						With Great People | 2015 - 2016 | Newton, MA USA
					</p>
					<p>
						I joined Richard Kasperowsk and his Harvard-based team, which specializes in team-based psychology. 
						I learned from them and together we trained and coached teams in mobbing, test driven development, code katas, refactoring legacy
						code, SOLID principles, objective architecture evaluations, and lean hypothesis testing. 
						I refined my knowledge of culture, coaching strategy, methods and tactics, understanding of
						pedagogy, and complex systems. We trained more than 50 scrum teams at five Boston-based companies. 
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Co-FOUNDER</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Athena Services | 2009 - 2015 | Lexington, MA USA
					</p>
					<p>
						Founder and Managing Partner of high-efficiency eco-friendly construction company.
						Applied agile methods of management on custom high-efficiency residential construction. By working closely with
						select tradespeople we were able to close projects early and with higher quality.
						Realized 50% reduction in time taken and zero rework in one-year.
						These successes propelled us into complex construction projects that included de-leading, hyper-efficient fenestration
						and closed-cell spray-foam insulation.
